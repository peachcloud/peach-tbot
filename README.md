initially just made this for my own use (@notplants) as I found it convenient for getting the IP address of the peach,
and debugging, even when the web interface isn't working, or I'm not physically next to the device to see the menu. 

peach-tbot runs as a systemd service, and reads telegram credentials from /etc/peachtbot.conf of the form
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=XXXX
TELEGRAM_LOG_ID=YYY
